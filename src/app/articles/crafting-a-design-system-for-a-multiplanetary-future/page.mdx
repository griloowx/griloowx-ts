Some who follow my personal life and my family know that we are Christians. I come from an evangelical background, and Bruna started attending church during her teenage years. My story with Bruna began in a church environment. However, I want to briefly share my experience of living in the various places I’ve been.

When I was younger, I started attending a denomination “for youth,” and it was within this denomination that I spent a decade. I met many people, some of whom are friends who visit our home. It was there that I occupied my mind during a time when many of my young friends lost their way. On the other hand, it was also there that I gave up many personal and professional things because they didn’t fit the routine of being a member, leader, and so on.

Before our little Mari was born, Bruna and I dedicated all our time and effort to serving the kingdom “as we were taught.” Our demands were high to be part of the growth that the denomination's “prophecy” predicted. We were like an army breaking boundaries, fences, walls, and traffic signs… It was madness!

I remember believing at the time that my “calling” was there. I did so many things that I didn’t even have time to seek God; exhaustion was something normal or for the weak: “this was God’s vision for us.” I rarely missed schedules, meetings, and services. It wasn’t because I loved going, but because we were “almost” obligated to be there as leaders, and leaders need to set an example.

Over time, our strength waned, and we reached a point where removing positions or “easing” demands didn’t help anymore because we had reached our limit. It was during this period that we decided to have our first child (a daughter, in this case). It was something we planned and was our dream. I also thought that, with a baby, we would be able to rest and have some time to ourselves. In our minds, the arrival of a baby should change things, with fewer responsibilities, etc. But that was just a thought!

During Bruna’s pregnancy, up until the eighth or ninth month, we still did the same things; nothing had been taken away, and responsibilities and demands remained the same. When Mari was born, two weeks later, the pandemic hit, and I remember it was chaotic for everyone to imagine how things would be with closed doors, lockdowns, and how we would pay the bills, which also affected the Church. I remember having late-night meetings to plan how things would be, while I only thought about my home with a two-week-old baby.

During this time, some tensions started to rise. I could no longer accept certain views and postures, and we seriously began to disconnect from the denomination. The pandemic gave people the opportunity to take care of each other, and in those moments, you only have eyes for your family; nothing else matters. I began to disagree with some things, felt sad because I thought some leadership actions should have been different, and this triggered various other conflicts. The denomination no longer served me, and I no longer served the denomination, so we decided to leave.

Our departure should have been a positive thing, but it took a long time to become that. We heard many things about ourselves: that we were rebellious, immature, and this caused us a lot of pain. After that, we went through three more churches, and each of these has something that reminds us of the years we spent “trapped,” creating in us a block, a resistance to wanting to participate in the body of Christ. These memories are diverse, often imperceptible, but for us, they are a huge trigger, like: “Oh no, not this again?” This is horrible for us.

I leave here a plea: pastors, know how to care for the sheep, especially those like me and my family. We are not “spoiled,” “resentful,” or “fragile” as we have heard; we are broken people, some even abused, the famous “24/7” for some is seen as a path to heaven. We are not to blame. And you, serious pastors, will increasingly have more of these sheep coming to you and need to take this care. It reflects the inexperience these denominations have with pastoring. Some, if not many, treat their churches like businesses and the sheep like employees, only valuable when they generate returns, unfortunately.

In summary:

The Church is indeed a place where the sick are healed, where we should be recognized for love and empathy, but it has increasingly become a place where the dirt under the rug shows up, and when it does, they want to sweep it to another rug, creating an endless loop. This is the chance for serious and God-fearing pastors to acknowledge their mistakes, be transparent with their sheep, and admit how flawed and dependent on God they are. But it is an ego struggle that blinds the eyes, creating a bubble that only grows.

I hope that soon we can reconnect with the Church of Christ, but at the moment, after a few years, we do not miss that environment. We still have many barriers to break as a family!

May God take care of the sheep from the wolves in disguise.
